## README

Ok, due to some hackery and time limitations, I had to do some weird things with Octopress to get this to work properly.

Workflow now:

`git checkout gh-pages`

`cd icukes-pages-source`

Create new content/page/etc using `rake`.

Generate the site source:

`rake generate`.

then, `cp -r ./source/* ../`

That will copy the source directory into the root git repository directory.

`cd ../; git add .; git commit -m "<commit message here>"; git push origin gh-pages`

Wait for github to build your content, you're done.

If someone has a better way, I'd appreciate it, but due to the way github pages works, this was the only way I could figure out.
